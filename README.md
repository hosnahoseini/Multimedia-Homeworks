# Multimedia Homework Solutions

Welcome to my multimedia homework solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to a series of multimedia-related homework assignments. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of multimedia processing and manipulation.

## Homework 1: Image Bit Reduction and Dithering

**Solution**: [Homework 1 Solution](/HW1)

- Implementing ordered dithering and the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm to reduce the number of bits required to store RGB images without significantly degrading image quality.

## Homework 2: Histogram Equalization for Image Contrast Enhancement

**Solution**: [Homework 2 Solution](/HW2)

- implementing an algorithm to balance the histogram of an image to enhance contrast. This process helps improve the visibility and quality of images.

## Homework 3: Image Compression with Huffman Encoding and K-Means Clustering

**Solution**: [Homework 3 Solution](/HW3)

- implementing Huffman encoding from scratch to compress images efficiently. The process involved converting RGB images to YCbCr and HSV color spaces, implementing both arithmetic and Huffman coding techniques, and DCT transform visualizing the coefficient values. Additionally, quantization was applied to reduce the data size while preserving image quality.


- implementing the K-Means algorithm for image compression. This algorithm clusters image pixels, reducing the number of distinct colors used to represent the image while maintaining the perceived image quality.
